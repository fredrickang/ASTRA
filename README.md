## Architecture Search for Time-sensitive, Real-time Applications - System-wide Multi-DNN Design
### Expanding Neural Architecture Search toward multi-DNN search under real-time system


**STEPS**
1. NAS for a single DNN with constraints
2. NAS for multiple DNN with constraints
3. Converting Real-time constraints into differentiable constraints
4. NAS for multiple DNN with Real-Time Constraints
